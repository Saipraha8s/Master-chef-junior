First we have to take a glass.
Second is to take a lemon.
Then we have to squeeze it until the lemon is out of the juice.
After that you can add carbonated water or normal water into it.
You can either add sugar for taste or salt.
Stir it.
And Voila you have yourself a cooling lemonade in the hot summer.
Have fun!
